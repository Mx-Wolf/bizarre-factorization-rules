Ridiculous Code Factorization

## The Task

_Develop a C# program that prints numbers between 1 and 100 to the console, with specific variations based on the number's divisibility. The program should output "Fizz" instead of numbers that are multiples of 3, "Buzz" instead of numbers that are multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" instead of numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5._
