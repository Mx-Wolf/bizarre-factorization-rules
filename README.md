## The progress

There are four sessions planned where we will be discussing the following topics:

 - Acceptable techniques for reading code
 - How to remember personal decisions
 - Advantages and risks of logging
 - Should we use onion layering all the time?

This repository contains branches that serve as starting points for each session:

 - [Step 1](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/steps/step-01) and [Competitive Style](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/drafts/step-01-olymp) are the initial points. The code implements the task in a school project style.
 - [Step 2](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/steps/step-02) provides a time-saving option with all future NuGet packages added. This is a starting point for refactoring the code to improve its readability.
 - [Step 3](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/steps/step-03) involves splitting the code and distributing it among multiple specialized classes. Additionally, we begin to instrument it with logging.
 - In [Step 4](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/steps/step-04), we use the code as a starting point for moving it in layers.
 - [Step 5](https://github.com/Mx-Wolf/bizarre-factorization-rules/tree/steps/step-05) showcases a ridiculously over-engineered solution for the initial task.

By following these steps, you can trace the evolution of the code and form your own opinion on when it becomes too much.
